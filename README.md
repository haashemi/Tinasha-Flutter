# Tinasha Flutter

An attempt to rewrite [Tinasha](https://github.com/haashemi/Tinasha) in Flutter. (But failed in the beginning)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer: 

This readme was written on June 1, 2024, with the latest Flutter version of 3.22.1, after just two weeks of using it. All of the texts below are my personal opinions and experiences. At the time you read this, a lot of things may have changed; even if nothing has changed, your experience might be totally different.

## ✅ My experience:

The main goal of this project was to get familiar with the Dart and Flutter ecosystems and the common challenges a newbie could run into. In the beginning, it was too satisfying for me, and I was impressed by how easy implementing some essential parts of an application could be, but as I got deeper, challenges were getting so much harder; styling a basic custom component was almost impossible for a newbie; unmaintained popular packages showed up themselves; navigation was too weird and documentations wasn't describing things enough; and overall, it wasn't a *fun* experience anymore.

However, the out-of-the-box performance was really, *really* awesome; build times were way better than React Native or Kotlin (KMP) in my tests; and cross-platform support was way too good and easy (I was able to debug web, Windows, and Android *at the same time* so easily). I wish Flutter a bright future, and I hope I can try it again in the future and enjoy the application development.
